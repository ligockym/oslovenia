Web application build on Svelte framework. There is Slovak and Czech version.

Online: [https://oslovenie.marianligocky.sk/](https://oslovenie.marianligocky.sk/)

## Why building this app?
I have had many problems with identifying what is the most important title of teachers on university and how to address him/her. 
So I collected information about all the titles used in Slovak and Czech republic and create app from them. 

## How to use the app?
Write email including titles and the app will tell you how to address the person acccording to the highest title. 

For example: `prof. Ing. John Doe` would be called `p√°n profesor`
